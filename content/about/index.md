title: 'About Me'
---

I'm Scott, and this is my site. I like playing, making, and writing
about video games. Sometimes, I publish that writing on this site.
Other things I like thinking and writing about include math,
programming, and economics.

Formerly, I worked at Ubisoft Montr√©al. Currently, I teach at
Champlain College and study computer science at the University of
Vermont.

My favorite programming languages are C, Go, and Python. The languages
that I work in most are C++, C#, and GDScript. I'm new to GDScript,
but it reminds me of Python and Go. I like that about it.

You can find some of my work on itch.io. There's only one game there
now, but I'm working on many more things to add.

I like making course materials for college-level classes. This is
lucky for me, because my employer pays me to do just that. In the
future, I plan to publish the course materials I've made.
