These are the articles and books that more-or-less completely defined my personal coding style:

1. [John Carmack On Inlined Code](http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html)
2. John Carmack on Functional Programming
3. The Art of Unix Programming by Eric S. Raymond
4. Compression-Oriented Programming by Casey Muratori
